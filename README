A collection of recipes for building Android apps from source code.  

Many of the texts are by the contributors to 
https://gitorious.org/f-droid/fdroiddata and those are under the AGPLv3. 
Other texts can be covered by any free licence and you are encouraged 
to add your own copyright headers.

We welcome your rambling descriptions and device-specific patches!
Write as many comments as you feel like!

We are tolerant of, if not delighted about, obsolete data. 
The Current Versions are updated automatically and perhaps infrequently, 
so they could easily be incorrect.

If you're distributing apks try to have a recent version and to
mention any modifications in the apk and/or description. If that's
not possible, change the package name with the custom_rules.xml template,
via the build.gradle or with the script in tools/.

Prebuilt libraries, whether included or pulled from maven repos, 
should have been built by a third party, unless otherwise stated.

By all means, include in-development apps; if they don't get very far
we'll add the 'Disabled:' field and eventually delete them.
This is also true for apps that aren't licensed properly or go proprietary.

Everything should build with a recent version of fdroidserver, but maybe not
on a build server so we need to be tolerant of dependency issues for some of the apps.
In particlular, the gradle versioning system for non-build server setups is
dependent on your path to the gradle binary and you might have to change the
gradle android plugin versions.

Currently this git repo is about 18MiB in size.
