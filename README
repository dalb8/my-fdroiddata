An Fdroiddata repo for building FOSS Android apps from source. 
Like the f-droid.org one, the texts are licensed as GPLv3; 
currently the git repo is about 15MiB in size.

Metadata here serves to maintain my own apk repository serving close friends 
and family; It has been tested and inspected to the extent that the apks build; 
they run on at least one gadget and that the only prebuilts used are via third 
parties.

The info should be accurate, but bear in mind that Current Versions 
are mostly automated so they could easily be incorrect; descriptions and URLs 
may be out-dated. If you wish to distribute apks based on it, please try
to keep them current, so that the developers will be happy; although I watch
the f-droid.org repo, keeping everything fresh isn't a top priority for me.

Everything is built with a recent version of fdroidserver, but probably not
on a build server so you could have dependency issues for some of the apps.
