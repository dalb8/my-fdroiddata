An Fdroiddata repo. Like the f-droid.org one, the texts are GPLv3.

Metadata here serves to maintain my own repository, so everything has been 
reasonably well tested and inspected to the extent
that the apks run on one of my devices and that all prebuilts are via third parties.
While I keep up to speed with the f-droid.org repo, keeping everything bang up-to-
date isn't top priority.

Everything is built with a recent version of fdroidserver.
