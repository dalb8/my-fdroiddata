A collection of recipes for building FOSS Android apps from source. 
The texts are licensed as GPLv3 and you are encouraged to add your own 
copyright.

The main requirement is that each app must have a maintainer: somebody who
uses it, looks at the source code when building new versions and has a
friendly relationship with the developers.
Apps that can't be maintained will have the 'Disabled:' field added at the 
top; if anybody is making use of this via an F-Droid client, then we'll need
to look into getting the status of the app in description instead.
Another principle is that any prebuilt libraries must come from a
third party; if there are exceptions they should be noted in the description.

Contributions are welcome from people who don't have a lot of time to spare,
so we are tolerant of, if not delighted about, obsolete data.
Bear in mind that some data, such as Current Versions, are updated automatically
so they could easily be incorrect.

Everything should build with a recent version of fdroidserver, but maybe not
on a build server so we need to be tolerant of dependency issues for some of the apps.
In particlular, the gradle versioning system for non-build server setups is
dependent on your path to the gradle binary and you might have to change the
gradle android plugin versions.

Currently this git repo is about 18MiB in size.
