Summary:Text to speech
Description:
Type and Speak makes your phone say out loud whatever you type! 
Save speech to use as ringtones and alarms.
Works via the share menu so you can have entire articles read out loud
and even choose the language.

Need to have TTS Engine installed such as [[com.reecedunn.espeak]] or
Pico (which comes with AOSP).
