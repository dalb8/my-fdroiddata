Auto Name:BusyBox Free
Name:Busybox Installer
Summary:System tools installer
Description:
Interface to install one version only of BusyBox (1.21.1) and its symlinks
to /system: for that the gadget needs to be rooted.
BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
small executable.

BusyBox is often used by scripts that manipulate /system
as the standard Android multi-tool (called ToolBox) is very limited.
However, BusyBox itself can be useful without root: extract it from
assets/ in the APK and copy it to /data/local/tmp on the gadget; set it
to be executable and you can e.g. replace the strange ToolBox [code]mv[/code]
with [code]/data/local/tmp/busybox mv[/code].

Note that the symlinks will override pre-existing ToolBox programs which may cause
problems in rare cases; again, you can just extract the BusyBox 
binary from the APK and copy that to /system/xbin or /data/local/tmp, but
at the risk that other apps that rely on BusyBox might not work.

If you run a custom ROM you probably have most of the applets
that you would ever need, though this binary has a few more.

The range of applets 
[https://raw2.github.com/linusyang/android-busybox-ndk/master/android_ndk_stericson-like available]
isn't identical to the upstream version.
Therefore, the applet manager doesn't have information about all the installed applets.

There are alternatives to BusyBox, like [http://www.landley.net/toybox ToyBox]
[http://kevinboone.net/kbox2_downloads.html KBox]; a version of GNU CoreUtils 
for Android can even be obtained from the Internet.

Anti-features: Addons. There is a 'pro' version with extra features but
the source code is published less often.

Theoretically it's possible to build binaries for architectures other than
ARM but in practice it's not as simple.
