Auto Name:BusyBox Free
Name:Busybox Installer
Summary:System tools installer
Description:
Interface to install one version only of BusyBox (1.21.1) and its symlinks.
For now, the binary is only for ARM architecture as the others couldn't be built.

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
small executable. It provides replacements for most of the utilities you
usually find in GNU fileutils, shellutils, etc. 
Android comes with a very limited multi-tool called Toolbox
and sometimes it is crippled even more, so a standard Busybox is often needed
by root apps that need to do different jobs.
If you run a custom ROM you probably have most of the applets
that you would ever need, though this binary has a few more.

The range of applets 
[https://raw2.github.com/linusyang/android-busybox-ndk/master/android_ndk_stericson-like available]
isn't identical to the upstream version.
Therefore, the applet manager doesn't have information about all the installed applets.

Note that the symlinks may override pre-existing toolbox programs which may cause
problems in rare cases; if in doubt, extract the busybox binary and copy that
to /system/xbin.
