Name:Browser Intercept
Auto Name:Browser Intercept - Share URL
Summary:Peek at urls
Description:
When opening a web URL from an app, Android never shows the address,
only a choice of browsers or opens the default browser.
This app allows you to share the URL, so you can at least see what domain it is.
You can install [[com.nightshadelabs.anotherbrowser]] to give an option
to return to a browser option.
