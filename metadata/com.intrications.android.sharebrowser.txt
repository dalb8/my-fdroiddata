Name:Browser Intercept
Auto Name:Browser Intercept - Share URL
Summary:Peek at urls
Description:
When opening a web URL from an app Android only lets you open it in a browser.
By opening the URL instead with this app, you can have it open in other types
of apps.

[[nu.clw.intentlinkopener]] is a useful companion which can display
the full text of the URL, which in turn can be touched to give an option
to return to a browser.
