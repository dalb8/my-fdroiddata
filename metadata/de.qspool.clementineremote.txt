Description:
You need [http://www.clementine-player.org/downloads Clementine]
1.2.1 (quite recent) for this to work and to enable the remote Control 
in Clementine settings first.

Control the music player "Clementine" - access your playlists, 
browse the library, download files, change the volume via hardware buttons,
read the lyrics while listening to your favourite song, enjoy the cover art and more.

If you receive a call or want to make one, you don't have pause the current 
track, Clementine Remote can lower the volume for you. 
It also has many more features, for example exchange of music and playlists with a computer.
