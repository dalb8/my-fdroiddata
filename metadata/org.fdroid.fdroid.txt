Description:
Android is open in the sense that you are free to install apks from anywhere you wish,
but there are many good reasons for using a client/repository setup:

* Be notified when updates are available
* Keep track of older and beta versions
* Filter apps that aren't compatible with the device
* Find apps via categories and searchable descriptions
* Access associated urls for donations, source code etc.
* Stay safe by checking repo index signatures and apk hashes
