Summary:Encrypt email and files
Description:
APG is a port of OpenPGP for Android. Use it to encrypt and decrypt files;
in conjunction with [[com.fsck.k9]] it can encrypt and
decrypt emails, as well as verify digital signatures.

This version borrows a lot from [[org.sufficientlysecure.keychain]] so
may not work like previous versions.
