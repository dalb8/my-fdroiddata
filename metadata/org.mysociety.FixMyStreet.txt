Auto Name:FixMyStreet
Summary:Report street problems in U.K.
Description:
Using this app you can report common street problems, like potholes or
broken street lights, to councils throughout the U.K.

You shouldn't need to have an account to provide a report but you will have
to supply an email (Ed: guessing this based on website: the app wouldn't let 
me get that far because it couldn't tell if I was in a genuine location).
