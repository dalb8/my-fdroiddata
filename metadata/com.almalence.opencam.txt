Summary:Highly configurable camera
Description:
HDR, groupshot, burst, exposure-bracketing, night mode, object removal,
panorama, sequence photo.
Histograms, grids, white balance, focus mode and that's even before
the settings are opened!

Seems that even the premium features are available in this build.

Maintainer Notes:
Builds armeabi-v7a by default.

Lots of native prebuilts in source code that probably have source code
but the exiv jar has the same namespace as the developer and I can't locate
source.code.
