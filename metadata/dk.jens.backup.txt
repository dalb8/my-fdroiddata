Auto Name:oandbackup
Summary:Backup manager
Description:
Make backups of selected apps on your device and restore from those backups.
oandbackup enables you to save app data to a user-accessible location. 
Both backup / restore of single apps and of multiple apps are supported.

Requires a working busybox installation at the moment (often pre-installed on custom roms).

Status: Beta

[https://github.com/jensstein/oandbackup/blob/master/changelog.md Changelog]

Requires root: Yes. Copies files from /data/data, /data/app and /system/app.

(If you don't have root but have Android 4+ you can use the command-line
program ''adb'' from the [http://developer.android.com/sdk Android SDK] 
platform tools to make backups via a desktop computer. Note that it won't
work if the manifest has allowBackup="false", nor does it
seem to work if you restore to a package that's been signed with a different key: 
you won't get any warning in these situations and there's no way of asking the
APK or the backup for information. :-\)
