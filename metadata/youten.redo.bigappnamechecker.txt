Auto Name:BigAppNameChecker
Summary:Protection from a vulnerability
Description:
Android will be a security risk if the name of an app is more
than 380,000 characters. 
When an app is installed or updated a notification is presented showing the app's
package name as well as how many characters are in the app's name.
Works even if the app is installed silently.
