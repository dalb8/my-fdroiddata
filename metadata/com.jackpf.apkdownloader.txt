Auto Name:Apk Downloader
Summary:Download apps from Google Play
Description:
You need to supply the app with an Android (or GSF) ID which the Google
Play app assigns to every device to determine compatibility; if you can't 
grab one from an existing device that has the Google Play app installed
you can have the desktop equivalent
[https://github.com/onyxbits/Raccoon Raccoon] generate one corresponding
to an American Samsung Galaxy S4. There are options as well to set the
SDK version and country if there are compatibility issues.

The app also needs to be supplied with Google credentials.
It should be possible to authenticate with oAuth so you don't need to supply a
password.  Otherwise, you can create a throwaway account for this purpose.
