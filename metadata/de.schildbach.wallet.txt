Summary:Store digital currency
Description:
* No cloud server or web service needed: this wallet works peer to peer
* Display of wallet balance in Bitcoin and various other currencies
* Sending and receiving of Bitcoin via NFC, QR-codes or Bitcoin URLs
* Address book for regularly used Bitcoin addresses
* Enter transactions while offline, will be executed when online
* Manages blockchain on your device
* System notifications for Bitcoin connectivity and received coins
* App widget for Bitcoin balance 
* Back up private keys to local storage encrypted with a password

A few tens of MiB must be downloaded to set up the blockchain and a couple
more per month subsequently to keep it updated.
When run for the first time, it can happen that the app shows only a white 
display for some seconds.

Maintainer Notes:
This won't build proguard: need to run mvn -Prelease for that.

See wallet/{README,CHANGES} or git log for info about what BitcoinJ tag to use.
Use latest commit in 'prod' branch, which is a rebase on top of the latest tag.
