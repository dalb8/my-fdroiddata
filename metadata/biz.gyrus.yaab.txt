Auto Name:YAAB
Summary:Control screen brightness
Description:
This is a small custom brightness regulator app. The idea is to make
screens of old devices like HTC Desire dimmer, as dim as possible.
Of course HTC Sense on Desire has auto brightness feature, but average
brightness level set by Sense is pretty much higher than needed for
comfortable work. For people who use their devices for reading books,
emails, texting, etc. this kind of application would allow to save up to
30% of battery. The website has a full explanation of the ideas
behind the operation.
