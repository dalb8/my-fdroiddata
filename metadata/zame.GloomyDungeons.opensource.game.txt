Maintainer Notes:
I build this by patching fdroidserver to avoid ant clean

Makes use of ruby 1.8, but works for me with 1.9

buildjni=no should be used but the above is a workaround for a bug.

Manifest is patched because network permissions aren't needed.

In Market under zame.GloomyDungeons.fullversion.game & has non-free resources

Version is created based on the date of the build.
