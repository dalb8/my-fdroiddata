Maintainer Notes:
I build this by patching fdroidserver to avoid ant clean

Makes use of ruby 1.8, but works for me with 1.9

Manifest is patched because network permissions aren't needed.

In Market under zame.GloomyDungeons.fullversion.game & has non-free resources

Version is created based on the date of the build.
