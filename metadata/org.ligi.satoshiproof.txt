Summary:Prove chronology of events
Description:
Use the Bitcoin network like a notary.
For example if your bike is damaged you can take a photo; then the app sends
a small amount of bitcoins (a Satoshi) to a made-up address.
If you ever need to prove that the damage was before a certain time,
the app can check the history of the Bitcoin network to verify that 
the photo was indeed taken at that time.
