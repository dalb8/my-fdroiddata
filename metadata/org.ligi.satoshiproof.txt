Auto Name:Satoshi Proof
Summary:Prove chronology of events
Description:
Use the Bitcoin network like a notary.
For example if your bike is damaged you can take a photo; then the app sends
a small amount of bitcoins (a Satoshi) to a made-up address.
If you ever need to prove that the damage was before a certain time,
the app can check the history of the Bitcoin network to verify that 
the photo was indeed taken at that time.

Maintainer Notes:
The strange x86_64 ELFs in the APK are via the scrypt.jar.
While the libscrypt.so can be built it's not clear how to get them into the jar,
but it's not even necessary for this app.
The above should work, but it doesn't.
