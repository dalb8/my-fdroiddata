Auto Name:Clipboard Beam
Summary:Share clipboard between devices
Description:
If you have two devices with NFC and Beam enabled in Settings,
you can share the contents of the device clipboard
just by touching the devices together.

If you don't have NFC you can make QR codes with

Android gadget with a camera.
