Improvement on [[com.googlecode.eyesfree.espeak]], which hasn't been

Maintainer Notes:
Code is on android branch.

GPLv3 according to the website, even though licence headers say Apache.

Need wxwidgets-dev packages to build the espeak data.
Should be easy enough on Debian distros.
Alternatively, use prebuilt data by zipping the espeak-data directory in
wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/espeak/files/espeak/espeak-1.47/espeak-1.47.11-source.zip/download -O espeak.zip
