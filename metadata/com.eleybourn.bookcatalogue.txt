Auto Name:Book Catalogue
Summary:Book cataloguing tool
Description:
N.B The GoodReads integration won't work as there aren't any API
keys in the source code to make it work. If you are switching between
different APK signatures it is a good idea to back up the database
before uninstalling.

This is a simple book catalogue application, to store a list of your books.
Books can be added either manually, by ISBN, or by barcode if you have
[[com.google.zxing.client.android]] installed. In the case of the last two
methods, information including cover images is sought on the internet
meaning you can have a thorough record of a book in as little as 30 seconds.

One thing to watch out for is that in rare case, barcodes do not contain ISBN
numbers. This will usually apply to older trade or pulp books and a barcode is
often also present inside the front cover. If no ISBN is present a search for
the author's name may still give results.
