Auto Name:Ushahidi
Summary:Mapping tools
Description:
Press the “+” button to find deployments in your vicinity.
This build replaces Google Maps with OSM.
So there are problems centering the map: on the MAP tab you can 
find the markers by zooming out (but there are no balloon 
labels unfortunately); to get the REPORTS tab to show the location properly, 
press the Previous button then the menu item with the blank text 
to hop to and from the previous report.

Ushahidi is a web and mobile platform that allows you to create, visualize and
share stories on a map.
It allows individuals to share their stories on their own terms using the tools
they already have.
You can sync with any Ushahidi deployment and send reports with images and 
location data as well as receive alerts from others who have sent in 
reports to the site.

More recent versions of this use proprietary GMS for maps and Analytics,
and they can't be patched so easily.

Later versions use GMS.

Use "android.hardware.camera" android:required="false" to ensure compatibility with tablets.
