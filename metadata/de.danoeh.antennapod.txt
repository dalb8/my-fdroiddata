Auto Name:AntennaPod
Summary:Listen to audio feeds
Description:
'''N.B.''' The Flattr functionality is disabled in the f-droid.org build as
the API keys are not in the source.

AntennaPod is a podcast manager for Android 2.3.3 and above. It offers all the
basic features you expect
from a podcatcher, like streaming and downloading episodes, refreshing all
feeds automatically or adding them
to a queue to listen to them later. The Miro directory can be searched and
browsed for shows.
