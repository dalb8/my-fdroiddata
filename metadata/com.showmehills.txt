Auto Name:Show Me Hills
Summary:Mountain identification
Description:
Augmented reality application which overlays the names of hills and mountains
on a camera view. The supplied data for hills of the UK and Ireland is
better than that for the rest of the world.

Anti-feature: Tracking. Crash reports are sent without interaction, but
that can be disabled in the settings.
Google Analytics was removed before building.
Google Maps has been replaced with OSM but they probably won't work.
