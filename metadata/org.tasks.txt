Auto Name:Tasks
Summary:Task Manager
Description:
This app is built on the same code as the original Astrid app but differs in
several ways:

* No sharing or assigning tasks
* No iOS or web interface
* Third party apps need to update their code to support Tasks

Tasks is not affiliated with Yahoo! or Todoroo.

There's no syncing option currently, outside that of Google.
You can export data to primary storage but you'll need to move that somewhere
safe.
