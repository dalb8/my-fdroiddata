Maintainer Notes:
Releases are tagged, but according to backends/platform/android/android.mk (which also contains 
version codes), Market uploads take priority. They may lag notably behind general development, 
so checking http://sourceforge.net/projects/scummvm/files/scummvm/ is advisable as well.
