Unlike upstream build, this one has all plugins bundled together in single apk. External plugin apks 
(e.g. from Google Play) won't work with this version and must be removed before installing it.

Maintainer Notes:
Made quick fix to work since bindir parameter was removed: not tested

Todo: Can use make directly now with output parameter.

Releases are tagged, but according to backends/platform/android/android.mk (which also contains 
version codes), Market uploads take priority. They may lag notably behind general development, 
so checking http://sourceforge.net/projects/scummvm/files/scummvm/ is advisable as well.
