Auto Name:K-9 Mail
Summary:Full-featured email client
Description:
E-mail client supporting multiple accounts, POP3, IMAP and Push IMAP.
Settings and account configurations can be exported so that they can be imported
easily if you are switching packages/signatures: a file manager will need to be 
already installed to achieve this.

If you would like to contribute financially to k9mail, consider donating to
the local SPCA (Societies for the prevention of cruelty to animals).
