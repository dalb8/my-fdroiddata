Auto Name:K-9 Mail
Summary:Full-featured email client
Description:
E-mail client supporting multiple accounts, POP3, IMAP and Push IMAP.
Settings and account configurations can be exported so that they can be imported
easily if you are switching packages/signatures: a file manager will need to be 
already installed to achieve this.
