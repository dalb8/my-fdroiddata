Auto Name:Bushido Blocks
Summary:Block-matching game
Description:
Test your skills and master the way of the Samurai in this fast-paced and
addictive Bejeweled-style puzzle game!
Tap matches of three or more blocks to slice them with your katana.
The more blocks you can slice in one go, the more time you gain in a race
against the clock.
Special blocks eliminate whole rows of blocks but don't give you any extra
time, so use them wisely!
