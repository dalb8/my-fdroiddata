Auto Name:OCR Test
Summary:Convert camera images to text
Description:
N.B. The direct translation function won't work as it requires API keys which are
not in the source.
It is possible to long-press the result to copy it, so that it can be pasted
into a browser or a dictionary.

Experimental app for optical character recognition (OCR).
Runs the Tesseract 3.02 OCR engine on your device to find text in images
captured by the device camera, without uploading your images to a server.
It is suitable for recognizing individual words or short phrases of text.

The default single-shot capture runs OCR on a snapshot image that's captured
when you click the shutter button, like a regular photo.
When the "continuous preview" checkbox is checked, the app shows a dynamic,
real-time display of what the device is recognizing right beside the camera
viewfinder. The continuous preview mode works best on a fast device. The
app supports x86 natively.

# Point the device at some text and touch the on-screen shutter button to start OCR
# To copy text to the clipboard or share text, long-press on the text after pressing the shutter button
# For recognizing individual Chinese/Japanese/Korean characters, access the settings and set the page segmentation mode to "single character"

RECOGNITION ACCURACY
* Various factors can cause the OCR to fail: uneven illumination, stylized text, or text without enough contrast from the background. Try to have good lighting
* Hold the device steady, and be sure the picture is in focus
* If you need to scan a large block of text or an entire document, consider using a flatbed document scanner

Supported languages for OCR: Arabic, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese (Simplified),
Chinese (Traditional), Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Finnish, French, German,
Greek, Hindi, Hungarian, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Latvian,
Lithuanian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian (Latin), Slovak,
Slovenian, Spanish, Swedish, Tagalog, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, and Vietnamese.
Arabic OCR requires a large amount of RAM. If your device doesn't have enough
RAM, the app will quit during OCR. The preferred language can be chosen in
the settings.
