Auto Name:Speed of Sound
Summary:Adjust volume according to speed
Description:
Keep your eyes on the road, not your phone! Speed of Sound automatically
adjusts your music player’s volume while you’re driving about with your GPS,
lowering the volume while driving slowly or at a stoplight,
and cranking it up on the highway.

In this build, Google Maps are replaced with OSM.
More recent versions use the Google Play Services library for the maps:
it's not yet possible to replace that with an OSM equivalent.
