Auto Name:Network Location
Summary:Device location provider
Description:
Replacement for network location services, normally existing on
phones that you buy, but not part of AOSP.

'''This version isn't for Android 4.4 and above''':
use [[com.google.android.gms]] instead.

Because of the permissions it needs, this needs to be installed in /system.
Copy to phone, remount /system, move to '''/system/app/''' fix the 
permissions and reboot; updates can be installed as normal.
It won't work until it can recognise at least a couple of nearby networks.

Network location services were found in NetworkLocation.apk in older Android versions 
but they're now part of the Google Play Services apk (or perhaps another).

Sources are currently limited to Apple Corp's database.
opencellid is usually working and others are on the way.
