Auto Name:Transportr
Summary:Public Transport Companion
Description:
The public transport companion that respects your privacy and your freedom.
Transportr is a non-profit app developed by people around the world to make
using public transport as easy as possible wherever you are.

Currently, it works best in Europe, but also supports many places world-wide. If
you live in an unsupported area, consider adding it to Transportr.

It finds directions from your home, your current position or a given station to
wherever you want to go. You can also save entire trips as favorites and find
next trips with one click.

Discover nearby stations and show upcoming departures including the delays (if
there are any).
