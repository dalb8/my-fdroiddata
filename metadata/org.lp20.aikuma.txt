Auto Name:Aikuma
Summary:Record oral histories
Description:
For recording and translating spoken language. 
Make your own recordings, share them, and translate recordings into other languages.

A special feature of Aikuma is its voice-driven translation mode. 
Hold the phone to your ear and listen, and interrupt to give a commentary or 
translation. 
The phone records what you say and lines it up with the original. Now the meaning is also preserved.

Aikuma means “meeting” in Usarufa, a language of Papua New Guinea where this technology was first tested.
