Auto Name:IntentLinkOpener
Summary:Useful utility
Description:
Android often doesn’t tell you where a link points to and
if it does then it doesn’t show the full URL.
For example, to find the source code URL for this app (from F-Droid)
you have to open a browser to find out.

The workaround is to open the link with 
[[com.intrications.android.sharebrowser]] then open it with this app.

The app can also serve to open certain files in different ways e.g.
to stream an OGG file via VLC instead of downloading it.
