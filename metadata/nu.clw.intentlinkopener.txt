Auto Name:IntentLinkOpener
Summary:Useful utility
Description:
Android has a useful share menu, but one still can't see what's
being shared: this can be annoying on small screens where URLs and
long texts are truncated. This app adds an item to list of share destinations
so the object can be seen.
Works well with [[com.intrications.android.sharebrowser]].

The app can also serve to open certain files in different ways e.g.
to stream an OGG file via VLC instead of downloading it.
