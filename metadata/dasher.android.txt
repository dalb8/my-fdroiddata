Auto Name:Dasher
Summary:Text input method (IME)
Description:
Dasher is an information-efficient, text-entry interface, driven by a natural
continuous steering of the cursor into boxes representing the letter you
want to input.

Dasher is especially useful for text-entry wherever a full-size keyboard
cannot be used â€” for example,

* when operating a computer one-handed, by joystick, touchscreen, trackball, or mouse;
* when operating a computer with zero hands (i.e., by head-mouse or by eyetracker);
* on a palmtop computer;
* on a wearable computer.
