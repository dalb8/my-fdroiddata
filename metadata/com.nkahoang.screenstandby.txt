Auto Name:Screen Standby
Summary:Keep screen off while mirroring
Description:
Can make the screen dark without turning it off so that HDMI mirroring
will still work.

Some prebuilt binaries in assets/ were removed, but it still seems to work.

Requires root: Yes, but there is a non-root method available which
is less effective.

AdMob was removed.
