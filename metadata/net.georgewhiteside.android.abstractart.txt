Summary:Live Wallpaper
Description:
This live wallpaper recreates the hypnotic tripped-out visuals featured in the 
cult classic SNES game Earthbound (Mother 2). 
Even if you’ve never heard of it, these animated wallpapers stand on their own. 
With the hundreds of backgrounds available in this tiny < 300kB package, you 
practically can’t afford not to download it! Equip it now to give your device 
sweet visuals with low power consumption, and be the first person on 
your street with a totally boss wallpaper that doesn’t bust the battery.
