Auto Name:DailybRead
Summary:Read free books
Description:
* Find and read random books using the 'Today's bRead' section (quite fun and surprising what you will find!)
* View the book's info and what word was used to find the book
* Save books you like to your SD card for viewing later or reading in a different app
* Search through the entire OpenLibrary database of over 1,000,000 free ebooks

The random search acts as a sort of 'book roulette' by picking random words 
from the english language and trying to find a book with that word. 
You can see what words it is using for the search while it is looking. 
You can run this random search as many times as you like to keep finding new, interesting books!
