Maintainer Notes:
# Not likely to be updated but other ports can be found on Internet:
# 1 Older version of Natdon's, already unbuildable; original focus of most non-JP efforts.
#
#   Hosted on:
#   http://sourceforge.net/p/onscripter/code-0/ (earliest upload?)
#   https://code.google.com/p/onscripter
#
#   Package: cn.natdon.onscripter
#
# 2 Newer maintained version of CN fork, recently merged with MiNE3. Relies on closed-source vitamio.jar 
#   for video playback (see also https://bbs.vitamio.org/topics/83?locale=en).
#
#   Hosted on:
#   https://github.com/natdon/ONScripter-CN/
#
#   Package: cn.natdon.onscripterv2
#
# 3 Our package; was based on #1, but later backported stuff from various sources
#
# 4 http://onscripter.sourceforge.jp/android/android.html - upstream Japanese attempt. Also happens to 
#   be upstream for engine core. Use tarballs for publishing, but developer of #3 tracks them on Github.
#   APKs published in Dec 2013; there are a couple of extra features but the fonts are off.
