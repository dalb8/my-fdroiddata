Auto Name:Android Resources
Summary:List Android Resources
Description:
This application will list all public and private Android resources (i.e.
resources located under android.R.* and under com.android.internal.R.*) for
the current device. If the resource is a drawable or a colour the background
colour of the list can be changed to see how it looks next to a different
colour. Internal resources (anything under 'com.android._internal_.R') are not
guaranteed to be in all devices/Android versions. Do not reference them
directly in your application or it will crash on untested device
configurations.
