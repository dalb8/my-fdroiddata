Auto Name:Hydra Slayer
Summary:Adventure game
Description:
Hydra Slayer is a roguelike (that is, a game where you control a single hero 
fighting horde of monsters, with a high emphasis on tactics) where combat has 
been inspired by some mathematical puzzles about brave heroes slaying many 
headed beasts. 
This might look like a standard dungeon crawler, but the puzzle element 
is important, and the later game is meant to be challenging. 
Be sure to try the tutorial first or visit the website to see the back story 
and other tips and tricks.
The character can be controlled by touching part of the screen to indicate
direction, but bear in mind that walls can't be traversed!

* In most menus, you can touch a menu item (on screen) to activate it; most actions can be also selected by pressing the Menu button.
* On the race selection screen, click on the top part of the screen (which contains race names) or use D-pad to change race, and then touch the middle of the screen to play the chosen race.
* On the game screen, touch the corner which contains the list of your weapons to switch weapons (the most common action), and touching the corner which contains the stats and list of enemies opens a single menu including all possible actions (while Menu button shows just five). You can also touch the message box at the bottom to see messages which did not fit on the screen. Touching anywhere else is a move.
* Since this is based on a desktop game, most common actions can be also executed by pressing hardware buttons. For example, '''in the game, D-Pad moves''', Volume Up and Volume Down switch weapons, Call ("pick up phone") picks up items and climbs down stairs (just like the 'g' key on keyboard), and Search opens your inventory (like 'i').
* In questions, touching the top of the screen means yes and the bottom of the screen means no.
