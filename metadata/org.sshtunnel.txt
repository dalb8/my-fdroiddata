Auto Name:SSHTunnel
Summary:Browse internet via a proxy
Description:
SSH tunnel app based on Connectbot and Dropbear / OpenSSH (Beta Branch). 
With this app and a configured server (typically configured with sshd and 
nginx / squid), you can easily browse internet through a SSH tunnel on your 
android devices.
It uses [http://darkk.net.ru/redsocks Redsocks] to redirect all traffic.

You can find free shell accounts by searching the WWW.
After editing your server settings and credentials, enable the tunnel via the
switch at the top. If pages don't load or the IP address doesn't change
try enabling the socks proxy and Global proxy.

A proprietary analytics library was removed.
