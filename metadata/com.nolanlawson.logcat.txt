Auto Name:CatLog
Summary:System log viewer
Description:
CatLog shows a scrolling (tailed) view of the Android "Logcat" system log, hence the goofy name. It also
allows you to record logs in real time, send logs via email, and filter using a variety of criteria. It has
a widget, can record logs in the background and has useful colour coding.
