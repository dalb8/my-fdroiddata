Auto Name:CatLog
Summary:System log viewer
Description:
CatLog shows a scrolling (tailed) view of the Android “Logcat” system log,
hence the goofy name. It also allows you to record logs in real time, send logs
via email, and filter using a variety of criteria. It has a widget, can record
logs in the background and has useful colour coding.

Requires root: Probably not on a custom ROM (even though the app requests it).
Otherwise root will probably be needed above Android 4.1.
