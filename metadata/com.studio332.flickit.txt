Auto Name:flickit
Name:FlickIt!
Summary:Family game of skill
Description:
It combines aspects of shuffleboard, 9-ball and bumper pool into a unique new 
gameplay experience. 
Use your shooter puck to knock white targets into the holes for points. 
In 9-ball, the lowest numbered target must be hit first, but it doesn't matter
which target is holed.

FlickIt! is easy to learn, yet difficult to master. 
Just drag your finger to aim, tap and hold to increase power, and release to 
shoot. 
Be careful you don't overpower and miss the shot!
Challenge your friends to see who is the true FlickIt! master.
