Summary:Tools for Debian project members
Description:
App for maintainers, uploaders or developers of the Debian community. It
communicates with the Debian soap and rest api and retrieves information that
can be useful when you're not in front of your workstation at home or at
office.

It eases a lot of operations like checking the next DInstall time, submitting
a new bug report or responding to an existing one, getting info on packages
and on pending bugs for those packages, etc. 
.
