Auto Name:GPS Share
Summary:Share your location
Description:
Share your location as a Google Maps HTTP URL via any messaging app.
If the recipient has [[net.osmand.plus]] installed then they might 
be able to open the location with that.

This build replaces Google Maps with OSM.
It has problems centering the map, but you can find the position by zooming out.
