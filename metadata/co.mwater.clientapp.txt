Maintainer Notes:
install recent npm; set up ~/.npmrc to install packages as user
npm install -g grunt grunt-cli browserify cordova.

Don't think it's possible to do `npm install -g` to avoid downloading
dependencies each time.

A few dependencies are pulled in, some with prebuilts and they have to get pulled
in every time by fdroid.

Scanignore the opencv blobs; scan takes a long time.

Can't build 3.1.11 cos a dependency no longer exists.

Version code can't be got anywhere.

Missing icons for some reason.
