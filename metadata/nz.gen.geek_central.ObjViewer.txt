Auto Name:ObjViewer
Summary:Basic 3D model viewer
Description:
Copy the .obj file that you want to view (and associated .mtl file, if
any) onto a directory named “Models” on the SD card of the Android
device. It should then appear in the list that is shown when you
select “Open...” from the options menu in ObjViewer.

You can interactively adjust the orientation of the object by dragging
across the view; drag across the middle part to rotate about the X
(horizontal) and Y (vertical) axes, and drag around the periphery to
rotate about the Z axis (perpendicular to the view) as well.

To see any colours that might be defined for the surfaces of your model,
turn on lighting.

If parts of the surface of the object seem to disappear, try switching
the order of vertices in a forward-looking face under “Orient Faces...”.

“Reset View” animates rotating the object back to its initial orientation.
“Random View” animates rotating the object to a random orientation.

If you want to find downloadable models to view, here are a couple of
lists of likely websites:
