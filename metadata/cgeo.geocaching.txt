Auto Name:c:geo
Summary:Geocaching client
Description:
Geocaching is a sport where people hide things and you go and find them. This
is an unofficial client to access geocaching.com's list of caches, search and
save them to the device.

Google Maps are replaced with OSM in this build but you may want to choose
OSM maps in the settings anyway.
There are no opencaching.de/pl API keys.

You will need a geocaching.com account to the unlock the exact location of the
caches, and a premium membership to sort caches by distance.
