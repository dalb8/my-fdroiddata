Summary:Geocaching client
Description:
Geocaching is a sport where people hide things and you go and find them. This
is an unnofficial client to access geocaching.com's list of caches, search and
save them to the device.

This build has no Google Maps keys, but OSM maps (Mapnik and
Cyclemap) are available; nor are there opencaching.de/pl keys.

You will need a geocaching.com account to the unlock the exact location of the
caches, and a premium membership to sort caches by distance.
