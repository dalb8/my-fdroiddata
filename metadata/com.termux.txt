Summary:Terminal emulator with packages
Description:
Termux combines powerful terminal emulation with an extensive Linux package
collection.

* Enjoy the bash and zsh shells.
* Edit files with nano and vim.
* Access servers over ssh.
* Compile code with gcc and clang.
* Use the python console as a pocket calculator.
* Check out projects with git and subversion.
* Run text-based games with frotz.

At first start a small base system is downloaded - desired packages can then be
installed using the apt package manager known from the Debian and Ubuntu Linux
distributions. Access the built-in help by long-pressing anywhere on the
terminal and selecting the Help menu option to learn more.
