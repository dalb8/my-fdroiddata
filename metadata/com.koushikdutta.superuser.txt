Auto Name:Superuser
Summary:Manage root access
Description:
An app to allow or forbid apps' requests to run as root.
The entire app can be built from source with the Android
SDK and NDK, including the '''su''' binary which is bundled within and
copied to /system when the prompts are followed.
You must already have root for this to work, because it leverages
the existing su and Superuser app to install itself.
However, if you know what you are doing you can use this apk
as a su/Superuser substitute if you are gaining an initial root.
Once the install is completed you can disable or remove the old app.
.
