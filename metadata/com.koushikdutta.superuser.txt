Auto Name:Superuser
Summary:Manage root access
Description:
If you already have root the app can replace the Superuser app
and su binary that you already have installed.
Once the install is completed you can disable or remove the old app.

If you don't already have root (or if the something goes wrong) you'll have to flash a zip;
the build.xml in the source code will output a zip but it can be constructed
from the files in the APK under assets/. Put them in the zip as follows:
META-INF/com/google/android/update-binary; Superuser.apk; install-recovery.sh; 
armeabi/reboot; armeabi/su.
