Summary:Arty wallpaper
Description:
Live wallpaper that displays a different painting every day, or
optionally an image from your own gallery. It's dimmed and blurred
so as not to distract but double tapping free space brings it
into focus for a couple of seconds.
The details of it can be viewed from the launcher.

An API exists to make extensions for other collections.
