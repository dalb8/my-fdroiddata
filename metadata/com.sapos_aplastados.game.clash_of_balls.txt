Auto Name:Clash of Balls
Summary:2-player accelerometer game
Description:
Games are played peer-to-peer; so
no server is used, but each player needs to be in the same network to see each
other. If the device supports it, Clash of Balls should also run via Bluetooth.

The aim of the game is to bounce the other players out of the field by balancing
your device.The game should be self-explanatory, there is a Help Menu. When the 
game starts and the countdown is shown, hold your device still in the desired 
position, where your ball should not move. During the game, tilt the device to 
move your player to a certain direction.

For physics simulation, JBox2D is used, a Java implementation of the 2D physics
engine Box2D.
