Auto Name:SL4A
Summary:Script interpreter
Description:
Scripting Layer for Android (SL4A) brings scripting languages to Android
by allowing you to edit and execute scripts and interactive interpreters
directly on the Android device. These scripts have access to many of the
APIs available to full-fledged Android applications, but with a greatly
simplified interface that makes it easy to get things done.

SL4A is designed for developers and is alpha quality software.
Need to install a scripting language alongside, such as
[[com.googlecode.pythonforandroid]].

Hard to build: developer builds for now.
Contains Google Analytics.
