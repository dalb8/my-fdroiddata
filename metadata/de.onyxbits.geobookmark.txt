Auto Name:Geo Bookmark
Summary:Save timestamped geo-bookmarks
Description:
A simple home-screen or DashClock widget that allows you to record
your current whereabouts quickly.

Bookmarks are color coded. Blue icons represent exact locations, red icons
mean that the widget could not get a GPS fix within 40 seconds and therefore
recorded the last known GPS location.

In order to view a bookmark, a suitable maps application needs to be installed
(e.g. [[net.osmand.plus]]).
