Description:
You can search for lyrics from a list of lyrics websites without leaving the
app or go to popular search engines. If you have a Scrobbler installed
can detect
what you are listening to and search for the lyrics automatically.
The app is also able
to detect what the stock Music app ([[com.android.music]]) 
is playing, without a Scrobbler.
