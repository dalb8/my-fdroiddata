Auto Name:Orbot
Summary:Tor (anonymity) client
Description:
Tor is both software and an open network that helps you defend against network
surveillance that
threatens personal freedom and privacy, confidential business activities and
relationships.

Orbot allows access to Tor by accessing a local SOCKS or HTTP proxy.
On a rooted device, the proxying can be completely transparent i.e. the app
that accesses the network need not be aware of the proxy's existence; 
you can choose which apps go via the proxy in the settings.

Requires root: No, but you will need to use apps that allow proxies if root
is not granted.
