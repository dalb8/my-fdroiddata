Name:OsmAnd~
Auto Name:OsmAnd~
Summary:Maps & navigation; online and off
Description:
Osmand~'s features can be extended by enabling the plugins 
via the settings, which include online
maps from many sources, tracking, OSM editing and accessibility enhancements.
Map data of both vector
and raster types can be stored on the phone memory card for offline usage, and
navigation by default uses offline methods. 
Map data packages for many territories can be downloaded from
within the app and there is a desktop program available on the website as well
for creating your own.

Maintainer Notes:
Name srclibs in such a way as to replicate OsmAnd build tree

do another 1.5 update when the branch settles down
replace GPS Status with SatSat and elaborate description. see 
   https://f-droid.org/forums/topic/update-osmand-and-osmand/page/3/#post-8253 
add parking patch (already committed).

Could build gnu-trove via srclib
Don't really understand what the other build.xmls do: they don't appear to put jars in classpath
Qt in new_core branch
see https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-manifest/blob/master/current_release.xml
