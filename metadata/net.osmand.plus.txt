Auto Name:OsmAnd~
Summary:Maps & navigation; online and off
Description:
Osmand~'s features can be extended by enabling the plugins 
via the settings, which include online
maps from many sources, tracking, OSM editing and accessibility enhancements.
Map data of both vector
and raster types can be stored on the phone memory card for offline usage, and
navigation by default uses offline methods. 
Map data packages for many territories can be downloaded from
within the app and there is a desktop program available on the website as well
for creating your own.

Some code for tracking map downloads was removed.

Maintainer Notes:
See https://github.com/osmandapp/OsmAnd-manifest/blob/master/current_release.xml and
http://builder.osmand.net:8080/view/OsmAnd%20Builds/job/Osmand-release/217/consoleFull
for commits and build flags.
Not sure how those ant build flags are set and what they mean; at least set the
parking plugin.
 
The bulk of the APK is in the resources, thus making separate APKs for different ABIs
gives less benefit.

Could build gnu-trove via srclib.

Qt in qtcore branch.
