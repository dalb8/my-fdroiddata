Auto Name:Orweb
Summary:Privacy-enhanced browser
Description:
Orweb is a companion browser to [[org.torproject.android]], the port of Tor to
Android, which you must already have running for this to work.
Note that root isn't needed.

Orweb disables certain other browser features that could be used to identify
you and is otherwise very basic: lacking bookmarks, contextual menus and tabs.
