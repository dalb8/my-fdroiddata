Auto Name:SatStat
Summary:GPS, sensor and network status
Description:
A diagnostic tool that displays data reported by sensors in the phone.

GPS:
* Refresh AGPS data (if supported by phone)
* Status notification whenever an app accesses GPS (configurable)
* Location, speed, bearing and error
* Satellites in view and satellites used
* Signal-to-noise ration (SNR) for each satellite
* Time to first fix and time of last fix

Sensors (as supported by your phone):
* Accelerometer (acceleration and gravity)
* Rotation
* Magnetic field
* Orientation (azimuth, pitch and roll)
* Ambient temperature
* Pressure
* Relative humidity
* Ambient light
* Proximity

Networks:
* GSM/CDMA cells in range with signal strength
* WiFi networks in range, with channel and signal strength

Known limitations:
* Some phones will report only the network cell with which they are currently registered. On such phones you will only see one cell under "GSM" or "CDMA".  This is a limitation of the phone's radio firmware, and SatStat has no way of getting more information from the device.
