Auto Name:SIP Switch
Summary:Access Internet call settings
Description:
Android 2.3 (Gingerbread) and newer has a built in SIP/VoIP client.
The widget has two buttons: The left one gives you a shortcut
to the SIP settings i.e. to enable incoming calls. The second one allows you to
select how calls should be routed primarily: you can select whether all calls
should be made via SIP by default; only Internet calls via SIP (Airplane mode),
or if you want to be asked before each call.

'''N.B''' In this version the Cyanogenmod quick settings tile
was patched out.

For Android 5 (Lollipop) devices and newer: Google changed the SIP API, so the
functionality has changed. The left button now redirects to call settings, it's
one click from there to SIP settings. A direct link to SIP settings is
currently not possible due to restrictions of Android 5, sorry. The right
button (and also the quick settings tile) now switches whether all calls are
made through SIP, or only ones going to a SIP address. Please set "Ask first"
for "Make calls with" in "phone account settings", then this button will toggle
between asking and making calls through cell phone network by default.

Please note that by default the built in SIP functionality on Android only
works via Wifi on most devices! Furthermore, some ROMs of network providers
(branded phones) disable the SIP functionality. If you can't find SIP settings
in your phone's settings, this widget probably won't work correctly.
