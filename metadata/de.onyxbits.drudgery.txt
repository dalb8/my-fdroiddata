Auto Name:Drudgery
Summary:Battle the Boss
Description:
Drudge Quest is a simple memory game the objective of which is to
to get through the day while trying to avoid running into your boss as you 
move from room to room along the 'Escher Hallway' of your company's office 
building.

''How to play'':

Your working day is divided up into rounds of five minutes each. 
Sometime during each round, you must decide which room to move to for the next
round so as best to avoid your boss.
By setting the widget you will either cross the hallway or move to the next room on the same side 
further down the hallway.

Your boss is a dreadful person, who loves to ambush you in order to give you
tedious tasks. If you sneak into a new room, only to find him (or her) waiting, 
you'll be given a tedious task and the boss will move to the next room on the 
same side of the hallway. 
If your boss is absent, you look around, breathe a sigh of relief and 
plan your next move; the boss will have seen you though and will move to the
next room on the same side as you. 

Therefore you must remember which side of the hallway you are on and set the widget
to move to the next room on the opposite side of the hallway when the next round begins.
But beware, the 'Escher Hallway' is named like this for a reason: if you lose 
your bearings, there is no way to tell which side of the hallway you are on! 
However you'll find out soon enough in the next round based on whether you run 
into the boss or not!

Every round you earn experience points. You gain one point for running into
your boss, three points for not running in your boss and four points on
every fifth round you manage to avoiding 'boss encounters'.
