Summary:Send and receive SMS messages
Description:
N.B. No MMS on Android 4.4.

SMSdroid was designed as a basic SMS reader which would offload SMS sending to another
app. Since Android 4.4 however, there is a central SMS database with only one
app allowed access to it. SMSDroid still works for reading and writing SMS
but on Android 4.4 it can't write ''MMS''.

The proprietary 'admob' library has been replaced with a dummy.
