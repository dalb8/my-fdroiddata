Auto Name:Holo Counter
Summary:Simple counting app
Description:
* Press anywhere on the screen to count up. This is the main feature of the app.
* Press a small area on the bottom of the screen to count down.
* Set a custom step to count with. You can count down or up with basically any (whole) number you can think of.
* Set a title for your count. Right now it's just a cosmetic feature, but it might evolve into a saving feature at some point.
