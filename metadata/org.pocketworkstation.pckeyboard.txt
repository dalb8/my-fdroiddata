Auto Name:Hacker's Keyboard
Summary:Four- or five-row soft-keyboard
Description:
There are about thirty different languages covered, which can be enabled 
in the settings. 
For the five-row layout, the keyboard has separate number keys, punctuation in 
the usual places; tab, ctrl and arrow keys. 
It is based on the AOSP Gingerbread soft keyboard, so it supports multitouch 
for the modifier keys.

Contains an dictionary for English, but it don't seem to work.
The downloadable dictionaries probably won't work either.
