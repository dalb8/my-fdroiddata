Auto Name:Âµg UnifiedNlp
Name:NLP Base
Summary:Device location provider
Description:
"For geolocating android phones without Google's Geolocation service. It allows
apps that use Android's coarse or network locating features to geolocate the
phone which is usually faster and less battery consuming then GPS. If you use
your phone without GAPPS this might become a useful tool for you.  The real
location work is done by backends (plug-ins) that can be configured through the
UnifiedNlp UI. There is already a number of backends out there that use data
from various data sources, some of them working completely offline.  The same
backend technique is used for UnifiedNlp's secondary feature: (reverse)
geocoding. This allows apps like the Android Gallery app to convert geo-coordinates
to an address, resulting in better user experience."

If the device runs an AOSP-type ROM without Google services then this package
can be installed as a regular app. Depending on the ROM, the UI might appear
in the app drawer or in Settings.
If the device runs a non-AOSP-type ROM without Google services, it may need
to be installed in /system (needs root or custom recovery): Copy to phone, 
remount /system, move to /system/priv-app/NLP/, set the permissions and 
reboot; updates can be installed as normal.
There exists an Xposed module somewhere if these methods are impossible.

It won't work until it can recognise at least a couple of nearby networks
and rebooting might be necessary.

In older Android versions, Network location services are found in 
NetworkLocation.apk but they're part of the Google Play Services apk since 
Android 4.4, hence the package has the same name as that.
There exists a package that may work on prior versions of Android.

Test it by visiting this [http://html5demos.com/geo site] with Firefox,
with SatStat or another mapping app.
