Auto Name:Network Location
Name:Network Location for KitKat
Summary:Device location provider
Description:
Replacement for network location services, normally existing on
phones that you buy, but not part of AOSP.
Also known as NOGAPPS.

'''This version isn't for Android 4.3 and below''':
use [[com.google.android.location]] instead.

Because of the permissions it needs, this needs to be installed in /system.
Copy to phone, remount /system, move to '''/system/priv-app/''' fix the 
permissions and reboot; updates can be installed as normal.
It won't work until it can recognise at least a couple of nearby networks.

Network location services are found in NetworkLocation.apk in older Android versions 
but they're part of the Google Play Services apk (or perhaps another)
since Android 4.4, hence this package has the same name as that.

Sources are currently limited to Apple Corp's database.
Future updates will be known as Nlp and will allow other sources via plugins 
(backends).
