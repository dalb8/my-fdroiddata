Auto Name:Âµg UnifiedNlp
Name:Network-based Location
Summary:Device location provider
Description:
"For geolocating android phones without Google's Geolocation service. It allows
apps that use Android's coarse or network locating features to geolocate the
phone which is usually faster and less battery consuming then GPS. If you use
your phone without GAPPS this might become a useful tool for you.  The real
location work is done by backends (plug-ins) that can be configured through the
UnifiedNlp UI. There is already a number of backends out there that use data
from various data sources, some of them working completely offline.  The same
backend technique is used for UnifiedNlp's secondary feature: (reverse)
geocoding. This allows apps like the android gallery to convert geo-coordinates
to an address, resulting in better user experience."

Because of the permissions it needs, this needs to be installed in /system.
Copy to phone, remount /system, move to '''/system/priv-app/''' fix the 
permissions and reboot; updates can be installed as normal.
It won't work until it can recognise at least a couple of nearby networks.

Network location services are found in NetworkLocation.apk in older Android versions 
but they're part of the Google Play Services apk (or perhaps another)
since Android 4.4, hence this package has the same name as that.

Test it by visiting this [http://html5demos.com/geo site] with Firefox.
