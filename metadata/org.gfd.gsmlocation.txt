Auto Name:GSMLocationBackend
Summary:Plugin for Nlp
Description:
A  provider for
[https://github.com/microg/android_packages_apps_UnifiedNlp Nlp]
that uses [http://opencellid.org OpenCellID]â€™s database of cell towers
to make your current location available to other apps. 

This provider includes a database but doesn't send back new information.
You are thus encouraged to help OpenCellID to gather more cells in order to 
improve this project.
The database is licensed under CC-BY-SA.

Nlp (not yet available)
needs to be installed already as System app.
