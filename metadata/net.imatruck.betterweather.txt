It is based on the weather extension included with DashClock and allows you to set your own location, instead of relying on your network location.
It also contains more weather status icons than the original extension (Thunderstorms, Mostly Cloudy, Hail, etc.) and multiple icon themes (Climacons, Weathercons and Chameleon icon packs).
Full feature list includes:
- Manual or automatic location;
- Refresh on touch;
- Custom shortcut on touch;
- Forecasts;
- Wind speed and wind chill;
- Humidity level;
- Lots of icons!
