Auto Name:Telegram
Summary:Client for the Telegram network
Description:
Enter your telephone number and your address book will be
uploaded to the server allowing you to be connected with those 
of your contacts who are already on the network: a bit like WhatsApp.
Then you can message with them in a variety of ways.
Unlike Whatsapp your message history is stored on the server.
There is an option to make an end-to-end encrypted message and even
have messages self-destruct after a while.

This project is a close derivative of one of the official apps, with some proprietary
libraries removed: GMS for push notifications and one for bug reporting.
The server project is non-free though it is argued that a clone can
easily be made since the API is published; there are unofficial clients
for a variety of platforms, including GNU/Linux and the WWW.
