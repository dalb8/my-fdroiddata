Adventure Game Studio is a game development software, including editor, common routine library and 
C-based programming language that is primarily used to create graphical adventure games. Titles, created

The [https://github.com/adventuregamestudio/ags/blob/master/Android/README.md#adding-games-to-the-game-list Android README]

* MENU button longpress: Opens and closes the onscreen keyboard
* BACK button: Sends ESC key command to the game
* BACK button longpress: "Quit game" dialog
