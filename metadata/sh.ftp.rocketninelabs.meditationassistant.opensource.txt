Summary:Meditation timer and recorder
Description:
Help your practice with you an easy to read overview
of your progress, as well as a display of your meditation streak.
Your streak is calculated based on the number of consecutive days you have
recorded at least one session. 

A major feature in this application is the ability to share your sessions
online. Though entirely optional, sharing your progress online adds another
dimension to your accountability.
