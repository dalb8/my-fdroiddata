Auto Name:Bluetooth Viewer (LITE)
Name:Bluetooth Viewer
Summary:Bluetooth connection debugging tool
Description:
Features:
* Connect to any Bluetooth device
* Display incoming raw data
* Send raw data to the Bluetooth device
* You can confirm successful pairing, monitor incoming raw data and see exactly what is being transmitted from the Bluetooth device

Limitations:
* Devices that work in *server mode* i.e. devices that listen to and accept incoming Bluetooth connections.
* Devices that accept connections on *channel=1*
* Devices that don't require a specific UUID during connection.
* Devices that can be paired.
* Data is only displayed in ASCII.
* Some devices need an "activation signal" first before they would start sending data.
