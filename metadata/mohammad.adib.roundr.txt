Auto Name:RoundR
Summary:Round the corners of the screen
Description:
RoundR takes advantage of the fact that regardless of the device's color, the
screen is surrounded with a pitch black border, the corners of which are
rarely ever touched. RoundR places four small overlays at the corners of the
display, to simulate a rounded screen.

Newer versions of the app exist, but are proprietary.
