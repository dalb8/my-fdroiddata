Auto Name:Mounts2SD
Summary:Map device storage to sdcard
Description:
'''N.B''' 'Fix sqlite3 binary' was removed in this build.

Mounts2SD is no longer just a script for devices with low storage capabilities. 
It can be used for a lot of things and is useful on almost any device, even 
those without external sdcard.

Control the script, viewing current states and more. 
The script itself has grown to become a large storage and management script 
with features that control SWAP, ZRAM, mount optimization, storage 
thresholds, different external and internal MMC configurations, cache and more. 
The content management is able to move a lot more different content between /data and 
/sd-ext, including the new internal storage, which on some devices, is placed 
in /data/media, and it also contains more than one option for storing system 
content on both /data and /sd-ext.
