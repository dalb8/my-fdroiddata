Auto Name:Beam File
Summary:Share files via NFC
Description:
Adds an item to the share menu allowing arbitrary files to
be shared via Beam, an NFC-based protocol introduced
in Android 4.1.

To use it, tap the share button on any file in any file manager,
then tap two devices together, then tap the screen again. Only the
sender needs to have the app installed, but both devices need NFC.
The actual file transfer goes over WiFi.

The functionality is built into Android 5.x so this app may
not be necessary on the sending device.

A proprietary Google Admob binary was removed before building.
