Auto Name:Kontalk
Summary:Messaging for the Kontalk network
Description:
Distributed messaging system, based on community-maintained infrastructure.

Send and receive messages for free with other Kontalk users.
Kontalk uses your phone number to identify your and automatically adds
other Kontalk users you can talk with by looking in your contact list.
You can send any text messages and image (other media types coming soon).

Even in server-to-client communication, your phone number is irreversibly
encrypted, so even the server can't know your phone number: it is used only
for sending you the verification code, then it will be discarded.

The version here is an alpha release and doesn’t allow key management for
getting profiles working on multiple devices.

See [https://identi.ca/kontalknet this] site for network status.

Push notifications can only go via GCM so you won’t get them
if Gapps isn’t installed.

Note: JAR libraries not verified yet.
