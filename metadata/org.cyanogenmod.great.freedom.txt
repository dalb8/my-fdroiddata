Auto Name:Great Freedom
Summary:CyanogenMod-compatible theme
Description:
Changes alarms, fonts, lockscreen, notifications, ringtones and wallpapers.

The icons have been removed since most of the icons are for 
apps we don't have; they may be pointed to other apps later.
There's no replacement for Roboto Condensed.

Note the Android security settings allow you to remove the ability of 
themes to change notifications, thus saving RAM.

*The font is called Lato and is available under SIL Open Font Licence.
