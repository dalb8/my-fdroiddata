Auto Name:OpenPanodroid
Summary:Interactive panorama image viewer
Description:
It displays equirectangular panorama images (360 deg x 180 deg spherical 
panoramas) hosted at Flickr, local images stored on the device, or from any 
user-defined URL. The user can rotate the view by 360 degrees horizontally and 
180 degrees vertically. 
Panodroid supports kinetic rotation and tag-based image queries. 
It can also act as generic panorama image viewer for other third-party apps.

Google Maps is replaced with OSM.
