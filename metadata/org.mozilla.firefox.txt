Summary:Web browser
Description:
Mobile version of the Firefox web browser. Uses the Gecko layout engine to
render web pages, which
implements current and anticipated web standards. Features include: bookmark
sync, custom search engines,
support for addons and the ability to enable or disable the search suggestions.

Anti-features: Non-free Addons: The license of the addons/modules on 
addons.mozilla.org may be seen in the version notes of the addon and often the
license is Custom or other non-free. 
However there is no such license info for most apps from the marketplace.
Tracking: Stats are sent back regularly to the developers, but that can 
be disabled via settings.
