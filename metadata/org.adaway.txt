Auto Name:AdAway
Summary:Block advertisements
Description:
An ad and analytics blocker that uses the hosts file. The hosts file
contains a list of mappings between hostnames and IP addresses. When
an app requests an ad, that request is directed to 127.0.0.1 which does
nothing. There are options to run a web server
to respond to blocked hostnames and to direct requests to the IP
address of your choosing. You can download hosts files from the
app but it is possible to use your own and to add certain sites
to the white- and black-lists.

[https://github.com/dschuermann/ad-away/raw/master/CHANGELOG Changelog]

Requires root: Yes. The hosts files is located in /system which is normally
read-only.
