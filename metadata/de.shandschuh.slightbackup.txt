Auto Name:Slight backup
Summary:A very simple backup program
Description:
N.B. SMS doesn't seem to restore on Android 4.4.

This small program allows you to backup and restore specific data:
* SMS (only if the standard application is used)
* Call-logs (no voicemails)
* Settings (experimental)
* Bookmarks (only stock browser; no folders are supported)
* Playlists
* User dictionaries

There is experimental support for Contacts, performed via the internal vcs
capabilities.

The backups are stored unencrypted in an editable location on the SD card.
