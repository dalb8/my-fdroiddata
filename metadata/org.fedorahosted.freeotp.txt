Auto Name:FreeOTP
Summary:Two-factor authentication
Description:
FreeOTP is a two-factor authentication (2FA) application for systems utilizing
one-time password protocols (OTP).
Tokens can be added easily by scanning a QR-code or by manually entering in the
token configuration.

FreeOTP implements open standards. This means that no proprietary server-side
component is necessary: use any server-side component that implements
these standards - for example [http://www.freeipa.org FreeIPA], which uses TOTP.
Any standards-compliant implementation will work. Currently, FreeOTP provides
implementations of HOTP (RFC 4226) and TOTP (RFC 6238).
