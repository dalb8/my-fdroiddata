Description:
The Pencil tool draws lines, and the eraser removes them. The shapes tool allows you to use a paint bucket,
rectangle, line and circle tools. Two finger drag and zoom anywhere to navigate large images. Thereâ€™s a full
undo/redo stack, as well as a color picker with history, hsv, rgb, and hex!

The canvas can be resized when a new canvas is chosen. The artwork is licensed under CCBYSANC while the app is
under a new BSD license.
