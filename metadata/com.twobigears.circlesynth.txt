Some PD and Processing libraries are included as prebuilts since they are tricky

Maintainer Notes:
prebuilts (both native and the processing.jar) are too tricky for me but 
theoretically possible:https://github.com/twobigears/Circle-Synth/issues/47. 
The app_license string must be inserted because of Google Play donations mallarkey.
