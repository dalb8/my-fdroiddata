Summary:Abstract strategy board game
Description:
Isolmoa is a two-player abstract strategy board game based on the
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isola_%28board_game%29 Isola] game. It is
played on a board which is initially filled with squares. Both players have
one piece.

To begin, each player places his/her piece. Next, each turn of play is
composed of two actions:

* Moving his/her piece to a neighboring position
* Removing any square with no piece on it.

The goal of the game is to block the opponent by destroying all the squares
which surround him before being blocked yourself.
