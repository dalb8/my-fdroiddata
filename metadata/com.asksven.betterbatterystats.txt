Auto Name:BetterBatteryStats
Summary:Monitor battery behaviour
Description:
Find applications causing the phone to drain battery while it is supposed to 
be asleep and measure the effect of corrective actions:

* Spot drainers based on detailed information about the root cause
* Measure the effect of actions to reduce drain
* Detect changes in the awake/sleep profile and quickly find the causes (rogue apps)

The app displays bar graphs based on reference points as explained in the Getting
Started section of the Help menu and it is good idea to read that if you want to 
have any chance of interpreting the information.

Requires root: To view Network or Alarm stats root access will need to be granted. 
On Android 4.4 the app should be in /system/priv-app; the app might achieve this with
root access.

Google Analytics and Locale SDK integration were removed.
