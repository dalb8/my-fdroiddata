Auto Name:Adblock Plus
Summary:Ad blocker
Description:
Adblock Plus runs in the background and filters ads, using the same filters as
the Adblock Plus browser extension.
Without needing root, it uses a proxy feature that comes with Android 3.1+
to block ads over WiFi ; but if your phone comes with
extra proxy settings (e.g. Samsung or Custom ROMs), it can be
configured for Android 3.0 and below.
Instructions are provided in the app or on their
[https://adblockplus.org/en/android-config website].

Requires root: No. Without root it uses a local proxy to filter ads for all apps
'''over WiFi only''' ; if you allow root the app can edit the hosts file too and
block ads on cellular data access points.
The proxy does use quite a bit of RAM but the root method does not.

Anti-features: Tracking: The app checks regularly for new versions 
on the developers' website. Ads: Adblock plus have an 'acceptable ads' 
policy so ads from certain companies won't be blocked. The ads aren't been shown
within this app so this anti-feature serves as a temporary warning.

''Firefox'' has addons for Adblock Plus and Adblock Edge which will block ads
just within Firefox and no other app is needed.
