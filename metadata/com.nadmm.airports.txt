Auto Name:FlightIntel
Summary:Resources for pilots in the U.S.A
Description:
FlightIntel is designed to be a resource to a pilot during all phases of a flight. 
It provides detailed information about 5500+ US public airports. 
AF/D data is downloaded to your phone and is available for offline use.
Free data updates as per FAA data cycle (Every 56 days for A/FD and d-A/FD, 
every 28 days for d-TPP and Library).

The AeroNav products (TPP PDF charts and A/FD PDF pages) are not available 
to those without Google Apps since it costs the author to obtain the materials and
that is currently the only way to make a donation.
