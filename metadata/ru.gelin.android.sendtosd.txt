Auto Name:Send to SD card
Summary:Copy things to the local storage
Description:
This adds an item to the share menu to save the object to the sdcard. 
For example, let's say you place a memory
card in the phone to look at some pictures. 
You look at them in the gallery and as you go you copy the good
ones to the internal memory. 
Not all things will be saved as expected: a webpage will only have it's url saved.
