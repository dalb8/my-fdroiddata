Auto Name:OI File Manager
Summary:File manager
Description:
The OpenIntents file manager allows you to browse your SD card, create directories, rename, move,
and delete files. It also acts as an extension to other applications to display "Open" and "Save"
dialogs.

Note that this is included in older versions of Cyanogenmod as a system application, so
you will not be able to upgrade it without first manually removing (as root) the existing version.
