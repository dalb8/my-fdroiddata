Auto Name:Paper Wallet
Summary:Back up bitcoins
Description:
Generates a bitcoin address and corresponding private key in 'mini' format,
or optionally the more standard WIP format.
Write down the private key and address then send bitcoins to that address.
If you lose the paper with this key (or if it gets wet!) you lose the bitcoins.

(Official description says:
You can securely and OFFLINE SPEND coins from your paper wallet 
without revealing your private key.
Check your balance via blockchain.info.

Seems more like the private key must be imported (swept) into Bitcoin Qt or
some online wallet like Blockchain.info. The latter also supports the encrypted
key option. see [https://bitcoinpaperwallet.com/wallet-tutorial-add-withdraw-funds this].)

Maintainer Notes:
zbar libraries are from official binaries on sourceforge. I tried to compile from
https://github.com/ZBar/ZBar but was unsuccessful. See trikita.obsqr though.
